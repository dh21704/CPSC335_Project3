# Problem 1: Set Intersection using Reduction

## Description
This project takes in two lists of integers. The program then output's a list of integers that appear's in both lists. The project demonstrates a reduction pattern, converting the problem into a simpler one by using hash table operations.

## Features
Prints out a list of integers that appear's in both lists (intersecting numbers).

## Installation
1. Need an online IDE
2. Needs the newest Python installed

## Input
L = [5, 2, 9, 1, 7]
R = [3, 7, 1, 8, 2]

## Output
[1, 2, 7]

## Algorithm Notes
Algorithm uses reduction pattern.
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

# Problem 2: Quick Sort using Randomization

## Description
For a big dataset where the input order cannot be predicted, this program implements a sorting function.  I utilized randmoized rapid sort since we wanted to avoid the worst-case scenario.  This creates an effective average-case sorting by applying the Las Vegas randomization pattern.

## Features
Returns a list of integers in ascending order.

## Installation
1. Needs an online IDE
2. Needs the newest Python installed

## Input
[5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 7, 1, 10]

## Output
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10]

## Algorithm Notes
Algorithm uses Randomized Quick Sort
Expected Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Worst-Case Time Complexity: O(n²)
Space Complexity: O(log n)
